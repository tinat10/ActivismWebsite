    <p>
    Due to gender, men typically receive higher pay, thus promoting the gender wage gap. There are also cases where women have to deal with harassment from those that hold higher positions, and even times where there is a lack of opportunity to receive higher positions or promotions. Such factors even contribute towards fear of speaking out and speaking up. An example of this would be if a woman tried to share an idea, only for her male coworker to share the same one and get all the praise and credit for it. </p>

    <h3 class="titles2">Education</h3>
    <p>
Gender discrimination in education is widespread around the world. Statistics show that 15 million girls of elementary school age will never have the opportunity to learn to read or write in elementary school, compared to 10 million boys. There is also the issue of stereotypes when it comes to careers. For instance, women are expected to gravitate towards careers such as teaching, childcare, nursing, and overall staying at home to look after the children, while the men get to go out and make 'bread' for the family.</p>

    <h3 class="titles2">Marriage</h3>
      <p>While the frequency of this practice has declined worldwide-from 1 in 4 girls marrying as children ten years ago to about 1 in 5 today-child marriage remains widespread. Similar to the workplace, there are cultures and places in which the idea that traditional gender roles should be fufilled at home remain implemented. Once again the instance being that the women cleans and cooks, watching over the house and kids, and preparring dinner for her husband. Even worse, there are places where women are married off at a younger age, due to their position in society being viewed as only good for child bearing. </p>

        <p>Media
        In recent times, there are characters in film where they are feminists, and are depicted as someone who hates men. Such further perpetuates a false stereotype of women. Other tropes have existed too, such as women only being there to serve a purpose for the male lead or women being pinned against one another out of wanting a mans attention, to the point where lack or amount of femininity comes into play. This falls into the misconception that it is good to 'not be like other girls'. Instead, media should be promoting that there are many different types of girls out there, and that each one is indvidual and unique. And more importantly, there is nothing wrong with being like others, (or different from them) as long as there is acceptance rather than judgement.</p>
