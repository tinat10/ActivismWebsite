var story = ["I work in a blue collar industry, and the men (most of the workforce) see the women as just admins in the office, regardless of their actual roles, and are less likely to do what's asked of them. I work as a purchasing manager and part of my job involves having to fix issues to get bills paid for close to 40 branches. I do a lot of process training and enforcement. If I call a supervisor or manager at a branch, and walk them through how to fix an issue in Oracle to get something paid (or show them how to do it correctly), I get ignored. But when my boss (male) makes the exact same phone call, they do exactly what's needed and act like they'd never been told it before. Absolutely frustrating", "During break time in my old secondary school, you weren’t allowed upstairs. You could only go outside or stay in the cafeteria. It also so happened that the school has intentionally made every female toilet on the ground floor which meant males could essentially never use the toilets because you weren’t allowed to go between lessons and you weren’t allowed during break or lunch time. This was because females apparently needed the toilet more than the males which justified the need for 5 separate toilet blocks on the ground floor to all be for females.", "In high school I wanted to take Diesel Mechanics so bad. I signed up for the class and all the boys were offered the class first. I was PISSED OFF!!! I love engines, oil, dirt, screws, tools...I love it all and they shut me down because I was a girl. I knew a bunch of girls that attempted to take the class and not a single one of them got approved for it.", "My first week at my internship, my manager gave the male interns the job of fixing code errors. The female interns got the job of cleaning (by clean, I mean scrub the insides and outsides with water and paper towels from the bathroom) the desks of the people who had just been laid-off. He's still this sexist 12 years later.", "A guy I met at a party once was making all these discriminatory jokes and at first I just passed it off, whatever, just jokes. But later, he begun saying that women were degenerates compared to men. According to him, we didn't have the intelligence to go to university or hold a \"thinking\" job and (pretty much) only really exist for sex.", "My DiffEq professor asked me if I was getting my MRS degree (I was getting my Master's in Computer Science). My dad told me I'd drop out of engineering to go into sales, because I'm too pretty to be a software engineer. My old boss told me that women are bad at programming because they can't think logically-- except me, of course. That's just the tip of the iceberg.", "Where I come from, police officers are some of the most highly respected people, and becoming one brought pride to my family. However, being a female police officer in Kenya can pose challenges. Kenyan culture is part of the African old patriarchal system where women are not placed in places of power. In most cases men will feel degraded if I arrest them. Sometimes they even use sexual advances, thinking that’s what I need to get them off the hook.", "A few weeks ago my husband's uncle came over for dinner. While we were eating, he goes on a rant about how women should not work in demanding fields because 'women aren't logical. They're too emotional and that women are too sensitive to handle stress in the workplace.' Then he went on to say that men should not be primary caregivers for their children because they will never be as nurturing as women.", "I work in a mostly male industry. In the office, there's only two women. We share a space and split a lot of duties. We're also the only ones, as far as I know, who keep any of the shared spaces tidy, but since I use these spaces, I don't mind wiping off the counter in the kitchen space every so often, or cleaning up the bathroom once in a while. Plus, this keeps costs down, since we don't have to hire a cleaning service. One time, though, one of our coworkers burst into our space absolutely furious. His office? A total sty. He'd had someone from another firm come to see him, and he was embarrassed and ashamed at the state of his workspace. Food left all over. Paperwork disorganized. Nothing had been dusted for weeks. This was his personal office, mind you - the mess was entirely his own doing. But for some reason he thought it was our job to clean up after him.", "A male professor in a different department was offering a course covering quantitative modeling of neural networks. When I expressed interest in the course he said, 'Um, it contains mathematics.'", "When I was in year ten, I had a male teacher tell me that I should discontinue my education and focus on finding a husband and having a bunch of babies because women are here to please their husbands and raise babies. I value my education greatly and graduated in the top 8% of my year level (national ranking). I spoke to the principal of my school (male) and was told to stop making waves.", "The one that always gets me is when I talk about some feminist issue or another, and someone (always male) goes off on 'this thing affects males too!' The other week, I had someone tell me that if the cartoon we were discussing (which was talking about how women are constantly judged on appearance) had male characters instead of female, it would be 'more relateable.' So wait - you can't relate with the female characters, so instead the women should relate with male characters? Oh, and any time someone tries to tell me 'we don't need feminism any more,'' and any variant of the 'what about the men?!'' argument. Yes, men face issues and discrimination, but there is no need to balance every female issue by mentioning a correlating male issue (if one even exists.)", "When I was shopping for a new car. My husband was with me, and the salesman that was 'helping' us did not even make eye contact with me. He spoke only to my husband. When it came to the test drive he asked my husband for his ID, gave him the key and proceeded to only let him drive the car. Needless to say we did not buy a car from there.", "On my first day of work, my male coworker complained to me how the dress code wasn't hard enough on women.", "When I worked in fast food I had to fight with my management to let me learn how to grill burgers because it was a dirty, messy job for the guys to do and why did I even want to learn how to do it anyway?", "I'm so glad my local comic store has female employees! It's a more recent development in the past few years. I used to feel so intimidated because I would go in there to look at manga and there were all these guys sitting around playing magic cards and watching me as I walked around the store. Now that there are women there it feels more friendly and I feel like I can ask for help and not be judged for it. It's awesome.", "While in Paramedic school I was required to do ride alongs with the county fire rescue. I was flat out told by a lieutenant that women have no business being paramedics or firefighters. Didnt take it personally, just figured he had bad experiences with females in his career. Didnt stop me from becoming a paramedic, either.", "My Mother constantly tells me how worried she is for my future and how she's not worried about my brother at all. This wouldn't have anything to do with gender if it weren't for the fact that I've consistently made better grades than him and yet she still sees him as the smarter one."];
